In an attempt to solve the issue of the buttons not stretching the full width of the window, I have discovered that Tkinter is not able to "see" the empty space to the right of the button grid that is not being filled. I have no idea how to solve this, and I have not seen an issue like this on Stack Overflow (where I usually go to when I need to troublueshoot python and coding problems)
